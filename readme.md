Welcome to Veterans in Technology sponsored by DraftKings
=========================
---------------------------------------------
My name is Mansoor Bahramand and I will be your instructor for the remaining of the course. A little about me is I have been a software engineer for well over a decade and began coding when myspace was still a thing ;p. Unfortunately, I can't make you a friend on my top 8 but I can teach you about development.
