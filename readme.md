Welcome to Veterans in Technology sponsored by DraftKings
=========================
---------------------------------------------
My name is Mansoor Bahramand and I will be your instructor for the remaining of the course. A little about me is I have been a software engineer for well over a decade and began coding when myspace was still a thing ;p. Unfortunately, I can't make you a friend on my top 8 but I can teach you about development.

Course Structure
--

The first hour of class will consist of review of the material from the previous class and the presentation of the material for the current class. The second hour will give you time to work on the assignment for the current class. Homework will be assigned throughout the course and is expected to be finished before the next class unless otherwise stated by the instructor.
